Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:04:21 PM): Thanks for verifying. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:04:59 PM): The deposit for USD 5000 is pending due to invalid SIN number. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:05:12 PM): Did your SIN number expire recently. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:05:19 PM): Or was it renewed? 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:05:20 PM): yeah it did 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:05:26 PM): I need to renew it 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:05:47 PM): Ok, once you renew it. Please upload the SIN document. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:05:57 PM): To upload a document, please login to myQuestrade.  Then go to "Account Management" -> Upload documents. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:06:06 PM): Once the document is uploaded, please contact us. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:06:22 PM): Then we can release the funds in to the TFSA account. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:06:46 PM): Due to CRA rules cannot accept funds into TFSA account with invalid SIN 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:07:07 PM): Until then will you hold my funds or return them to my US account? 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:07:41 PM): Yes, or if you like I can send the funds back to your US dollar bank account. It will take approx 6 to 10 business days to return the funds to your bank account. 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:08:05 PM): Okay, keep hold of them 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:08:21 PM): once I've uploaded the new SIN, how long will the transfer take? 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:08:26 PM): 2 to 4 business days. 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:08:49 PM): Once the document is uploaded, please contact as well. 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:09:29 PM): Okay, but how come the transfer will take an additional 2 to 4 days? The entire transfer process is 2 days 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:11:53 PM): Administrative tasks such as these typically take 2 business days. However, I can promise that. 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:12:48 PM): Also, how come I was not notified that the funds were on hold? If I didn't contact you, I would've never know 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:14:57 PM): Unfortunately, we do not have an automatic process in place to notify clients in such scenarios. We have to manually send out emails to clients in such cases. We would have intimated you by email after a few more days have passed. 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:15:51 PM): Okay thanks 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:16:10 PM): I will upload the new SIN by tomorrow and contact support 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:16:27 PM): is there an issue number I can refer to when I contact support again? 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:17:32 PM): There is no need for that. You just need to inform the chat agent that your $5000 PAD is pending due to invalid SIN. The chat agent would know what to do. You can refer to our chat ref number 00211929. You can also save this chat for future reference. \ 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:18:01 PM): The save button is on top left. 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:18:10 PM): Okay 
Jobby J (9/13/2018, 3:18:28 PM): You are welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with, Abizer/ 
Me (9/13/2018, 3:19:16 PM): No that's allo
